        It's a, it's a vibe, ain't it?
        You gonna grind, baby
        Take your time with it
        Baby, I don't mind with it
        It's a, it's a vibe, ain't it?
        You gonna grind, baby
        Take your time with it
        Baby, I don't mind with it
        
        How we turn this house we live into a prison?
        Guess you wish you never fell in love with me
        Don't know how we got to not sharing the kitchen
        Sometimes I wish that we didn't fall too deep
        We lose sleep arguing
        Worst part about it is you never went to bed without me
        And now you always wanna be alone, oh
        
        Neither side wants to take an L and be the one to blame
        Somehow it's my fault, no problem
        In your eyes, I can see you think that we will never change (yeah)
        
        Baby, maybe we was just delusional
        Too ambitious, no consistency
        In the end we were two fools in love
        When we fell, it was a free fall, baby
        We was just delusional
        We came an hour late
        Our time has been delayed
        Baby, we delusional
        Delusional
        
        It's a, it's a vibe, ain't it?
        You gonna grind, baby
        Take your time with it
        Baby, I don't mind with it
        It's a vibe, ain't it?
        You gonna grind, baby
        Take your time with it
        Baby, I don't mind with it
        
        We can manage our emotions for a minute
        Before you start subbin' me on your IG
        How is it I'm still the same but treated different?
        I'm still that nigga that you see on my ID
        We lose sleep arguing
        Worst part about it is you never went to bed without me
        And now you always wanna be alone, no
        Neither side wants to take an L and be the one to blame
        Somehow it's my fault, no problem
        In your eyes, I can see you think that we will never change (yeah)

        We was just delusional
        We came an hour late
        Our time has been delayed
        Baby, we delusional
        Delusional
        
        Part of me was letting you just play with my mind
        While the other had me thinking that you just needed time
        Probably circle back so much, we keep on pressing rewind
        And I need you to only be mine (ooh)
        
        Neither side wants to take an L and be the one to blame
